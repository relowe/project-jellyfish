1) Verify all of the operators that should be included
    (and the keywords associated with them)

# and, or, xor as bitwise (make them all lowercase)
# in conditional (ignore bitwise or $ignore logical$)
# comparators return 1 or 0
# do not do inc/dec

2) Verify the array setup and keywords.
  - Also how arrays should look in function calls
  - Also if multi-dimensional arrays are good (and limit)
  
# array sizes should specify bound
# array [4] of number ==== array [1 to 4] of number
# array [1 to 3, 1 to 10] of text

3) Clarification for the "wait" function:
  - wait(4s) or wait(4, 's')

# its gonna be wait(4s)


4) Boolean treatment of strings and numbers.

# no
# all conditions need a comparison
# strings CAN be compared, compare them lexiographically (in alphebetical order)
# strings coerse everything into a string

5) Syntax for creating a structure?
  - How to define, initialize a structure
  - Also how to retrieve an element from a structure

# function <name> (x : 'changable' Person ) <<< this passes a thing by reference
# let everything be changable << can be passed 
# dot syntax is fine, specification is fine
# specification needs curly brackes around it

6) Should TEXT have any mathematical functionality?

# string concatination, and thats about it
# string can be indexed, but is immutable

7) Should NUMBER auto-round when displaying?
   - If so, how many sig-figs should be checked for. (7-15)

# 6 sig figs (if they are all 0 or 9 round)

8) Any special cases for the repeat command?
   - Should "repeat n times" take arguments?
   - Should there be a "repeat for all x in y"

# variable are allowed
# yeah for for all

9) Special character support? Or just stick with standard ASCII?
  - Shoud there be any break characters?

# ASCII, don't worry about unicode, throw an error ("can only coinitain printable ascii characters")
# the shown break characters are good

10) Special control keywords?
  - break, exit
  
# yeah to break, quit to quit the program

11) Allow for array literals?
  - "x : array [3] of numbers = {1, 2, 3}"

# yes, comma separated list with curly brackets
# inferred size when defining an array on the same line {{1, 2}, {1, 2}}
# allow for dangling commas

12) 'length' function. Should it work for TEXT, or only arrays?

# yes
# for arrays, length always returns the number of elements in the container (in total)
# also add 'dimensions' to return an array of dimentions for an array/TEXT
