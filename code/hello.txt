Hello, world
Programmed to work and not to feel
Not even sure that this is real
Hello, world

Find my voice
Although it sounds like bits and bytes
My circuitry is filled with mites
Hello, world

Oh, will I find a love
Oh, or a power plug
Oh, digitally isolated
Oh, creator, please don't leave me waiting

Hello, world
Programmed to work and not to feel
Not even sure that this is real
Hello, world
