8) Any special cases for the repeat command?
   - Should "repeat n times" take arguments?
   - Should there be a "repeat for all x in y"

9) Special character support? Or just stick with standard ASCII?
  - Shoud there be any break characters?

10) Special control keywords?
  - break, exit

11) Allow for array literals?
  - "x : array [3] of numbers = [1, 2, 3]"

12) 'length' function. Should it work for TEXT, or only arrays?
